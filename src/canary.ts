/**
 * Noticing a model that answers 200 with nothing worth reading.
 *
 * A backend can be reachable, hold its model and return HTTP 200 while every
 * answer is empty or the same character repeated. Checks that ask "did bytes
 * arrive" pass, because the bytes arrive. The check that catches it asks "does
 * it still know anything": a question with one right answer, in a handful of
 * tokens, and a look at what comes back.
 *
 * Two halves, in this order:
 *   - The policy, which holds no sockets. `analyseAnswer` judges one final
 *     answer against an expected pattern, `DegenerateScan` reads a stream as it
 *     is proxied without buffering it, and `Canary` schedules the probes and
 *     keeps the per-model state. Everything about a backend (is it warm, is it
 *     busy, how is it asked) is supplied to it, so the state machine can be
 *     driven in a test with no HTTP at all.
 *   - The host half, at the bottom: `createCanary` supplies those things from a
 *     running node's pool, `askModel` sends the probe, `webhook` posts a state
 *     change, and `degradedError` words the refusal.
 *
 * Off unless `canary:` is configured, because a heartbeat that talks to a model
 * on its own schedule is not something to switch on for someone.
