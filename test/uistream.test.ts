/**
 * The page, pushed instead of polled.
 *
 * `/ui/data` is 95KB and the page asked for all of it every 3 seconds. 93% of
 * that is `hist` — 120 samples, of which the client already had 119. So this
 * sends one snapshot and then only what changed, with new samples appended
 * singly.
 *
 * What is pinned here is the part that could rot silently: that a patch really
 * is a patch (not a whole payload wearing a different event name), that an
 * idle node sends NOTHING rather than a frame saying nothing, and that an open
 * stream cannot hold a shutdown — a page left open in a tab is exactly the
 * connection that would sit out the whole drain.
