/**
 * Every response shape a degenerate answer can arrive in.
 *
 * Passive detection watches what hearth relays, and "the model is emitting
 * `!!!!`" does not look the same in each shape. The first version read chat
 * deltas only, which left three real holes:
 *
 *   - the legacy completions shape (`choices[].text`) — a whole endpoint
 *     (`/v1/completions`) whose junk was never looked at;
 *   - a NON-STREAMED body, which carries the answer inside JSON rather than as
 *     deltas, so nothing was extracted from it and only a crude raw-byte run
 *     check applied — `! ! ! !` spaced out slipped straight through;
 *   - the reasoning spellings a reasoning model actually uses
 *     (`reasoning_content`, `reasoning`), which are the channel gpt-oss fills.
 *
 * One case per shape, and a good answer in each shape that must not be flagged.
