/**
 * Catching the `!!!!` on its way past, not on the next tick.
 *
 * A probe every 30s means the first garbage answer a client gets is always at
 * least one probe interval old, and under a broken seat every real request is
 * garbage anyway — so the traffic itself is the best evidence there is. This
 * watches the bytes as they are relayed and never holds them: the proxy writes
 * each chunk on immediately, and the watcher keeps only a bounded tail.
 *
 * The bar for calling real traffic degenerate is higher than the bar for a
 * canary answer, because a false positive here refuses a working seat: a
 * character or a token repeated 32 and 8 times respectively, or an answer whose
 * whole alphabet is two characters. A markdown rule of twenty dashes is not
 * degeneration, and ordinary prose never is.
