/**
 * Self-check for per-model ceilings on a backend that keeps SEVERAL models
 * resident at once.
 *
 * The reason this exists: a model's own `concurrency` was written for
 * llama-swap, where one model is loaded at a time, so "jobs running on this
 * backend" and "jobs running on this model" are the same number and the
 * ceiling was checked against the first. Ollama is not like that. With
 * OLLAMA_MAX_LOADED_MODELS=2 it holds two embedders side by side and serves ONE
 * request per model at a time: backend concurrency 2, each model 1.
 *
 * Read against the backend's total, `concurrency: 1` on each model collapsed
 * the whole backend to a single stream — the second model was refused because
 * the FIRST model's job was counted against it. Left undeclared, two calls to
 * the same model were both dispatched and the second queued inside ollama,
 * where it shows as a slow call instead of a wait, while holding the slot the
 * other model could have used.
 *
 * `coresident` says the backend serves its models side by side, and then a
 * model's ceiling counts that model's own jobs.
