/**
 * A backend can declare an `activity:` path — where it reports its OWN busy
 * state — so a backend hearth forwards to but does not schedule (ComfyUI's
 * `/queue`) can light while it works instead of drawing idle through a whole
 * render.
 *
 * The reading is where the care is: a field is an array (its length) or a number
 * (itself), and everything else — a missing field, a wrong type, an unreachable
 * backend, a timeout — is "cannot tell", never a confident zero. Only a field
 * that read as a real count is `ok`, so the page can draw unknown apart from
 * idle.
