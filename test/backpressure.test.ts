/**
 * A client that hangs up while the response is backpressured shouldn't take the
 * whole node with it.
 *
 * This one was invisible for a while. hearth forwarded the body with a loop
 * that awaited 'drain' whenever write() returned false, and if the client
 * vanished at exactly that moment 'drain' never fired. The loop sat on that
 * promise rather than on the body iterator, so aborting the upstream didn't
 * unstick it either. run() never settled and the scheduler slot never came
 * back. At the default concurrency of 1 that wedges the node for everyone,
 * permanently, without a word in the log.
 *
 * The last assertion is the one that matters: a request after the disconnect
 * still gets served. That hangs forever against the old code, so it races a
 * deadline instead of trusting the runner to notice.
