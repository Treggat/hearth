/**
 * Shutting down without taking work with it.
 *
 * `close()` called `closeAllConnections()`, which destroys every socket the
 * instant it is asked to stop -- including the ones with a request half
 * answered on them. The caller sees a response that simply stops: not a status
 * it can act on, not an error the client library reports as retryable, just a
 * truncated body. On a box where a restart is how you deploy, and where the
 * work in flight is a chat turn or a render several GPU-minutes in, that is the
 * one failure hearth causes rather than manages.
 *
 * So: stop accepting, drop the idle connections, and let what is already
 * running finish. Bounded, because a deploy that hangs is its own outage.
