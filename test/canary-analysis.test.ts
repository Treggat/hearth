/**
 * What a bad answer looks like, in one pure function.
 *
 * A backend can answer HTTP 200 with 200 `!` characters, and nothing upstream
 * calls that a failure when every layer only asks "did bytes arrive".
 * A canary has to say what a GOOD answer is and then judge against that, so
 * this is the judgement, separated from the HTTP that fetched it.
 *
 * The cases that matter are the ones a naive check gets wrong: a reasoning
 * model that spent its whole budget thinking (not a broken seat, a probe that
 * asked for too little), a one-word answer that is simply wrong (a missing
 * answer, not a degenerate one), and a run of one character or one token
 * repeated to the cap.
