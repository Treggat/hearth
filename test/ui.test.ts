/**
 * The console and the one endpoint that feeds it.
 *
 * Two things worth asserting. The first is the gate: /ui/data and /ui/events
 * take loopback or an operator session, and a valid api key does NOT open them.
 * If that check ever softens into localCaller, a node bound to 0.0.0.0 starts
 * handing its queue contents and model inventory to anyone holding a chat key.
 *
 * The second is that /ui/data actually carries what the page draws. src/console/types.ts
 * now states the shape the console consumes, but nothing connects it to the
 * server that builds the payload, so a renamed field would still surface as a
 * blank panel rather than a failure.

// TypeScript template literal containing JavaScript, and a `\"` in the inner
// layer collapsed to a bare `"` on the way out, terminating the emitted string
// and making the script unparseable. tsc saw perfectly valid TypeScript, every
// other test here passed, and the browser rendered a blank page. Shipped
// exactly that on 2026-08-16 and only found it by opening a browser.
//
// src/console/ is ordinary .tsx now, so esbuild fails the build on a syntax error
// and `npm run typecheck` covers the rest. What is still worth asserting is the
// join: `npm test` runs build:console first, and if the bundle went missing or empty
// the page would serve a mount point and nothing to mount into it — which looks
// exactly like the old blank page.
